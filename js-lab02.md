# Chapter 2: Basic JavaScript Instructions

## Waht is _Script_ ?
### Script is series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.Each individual instruction or step is known as a *statement*. Statements should end with a _semicolon_.

>JAVASCRIPT IS CASE SENSITIVE: JavaScript is case sensitive so hourNow means something different to HourNow or HOURNOW.
>You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand This can help you and others who read your code.

## What is a variable?
### A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this data in variables.
 
>A variable is a good name for this concept because the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs.

## How to declare variables?

### Before you can use a variable, you need to announce that you want to use it. This involves creating the variable and giving it a name. Programmers say that you **_declare_** the variable.

## How to assign value to avariable?

## Type of Data:
  - 1- **Numeric data**: 1, 2, 0.5 ..
  - 2- **String Data**: 'A', 'nour', '12'
  - 3- **Boolean Data**: True (1), or Fuls (0)

## Arrays
### An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

# Chapter 4: Decisions & Loops

## There are often several places in a script where decision are made that determine which lines of code should be run next. Flowcharts can help you plan for these occasions.

## EVALUATING CONDITIONS & CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
### There are two components to a decision:
   - 1- An expression is evaluated, which returns a value
   - 2- A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation

![EVALUATING CONDITIONS & CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS]()

## Comparison Operators
You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. The result will be a Boolean: **true** or **false**.

![Comparison-Operators]()

## Using Expressions with comparison Operators
### The operand does not have to be a single value or variable name.An operand can be an expression (because each expression evaluates into a single value)

![Expressions with comparison Operators]()

## Logical Operators
### comparison operators usually return single values of **true** or **false**. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
![Logical-Operators]()

### What are the types of logical operators?

## If statements
### The **if** statement evaluates (or checks) a condition. If the condition evaluates to **true**, any statement in the subsequent code block are excuted.

![if-statement]()

## If...Else statements

### the if..else statement checks a condition.If it resolves to **true** the first code block is excuted.If the condition resolves to **false** the second code block is run insted.
