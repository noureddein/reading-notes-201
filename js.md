# How JavaScript makes web pages more interactive:
## 1 ACCESS CONTENT
### You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:
 * Select the text inside all of the `<hl>` elements on a page
 * Select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of note
 * Find out what was entered into a text input whose id attribute has a value of email. 

## 2 MODIFY CONTENT
### You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:
 * Add a paragraph of text after the first `<hl>` element
 * Change the value of c 1 ass attributes to trigger new CSS rules for those elements
 * Change the size or position of an `<img>` element.

## 3 PROGRAM RULES
### You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:
 * A gallery script could check which image a user clicked on and display a larger version of that image.
 * A mortgage calculator could collect values from a form, perform a calculation, and display repayments.
 * An animation could check the dimensions of the browser window and move an image to the bottom of the viewable area (also known as the viewport).

## 4 REACT TO EVENTS
### You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, it could be run when:
 * A button is pressed.
 * A link is clicked (or tapped) on.
 * A cursor hovers over an element.
 * Information is added to a form.
 * An interval of time has passed.
 * A web page has finished loading.

# What is a script and how do I create one?
 ## Basically script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow step-by-step to achieve a goal.
 ## To create a script you need first to state  your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

 ## Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.
 - 1 DEFINE THE GOAL
 - 2 DESIGN THE SCRIPT
 - 3 CODE EACH STEP

# Summary
> The ABC of programing
> What is a script and how do I create one?
 
 * A script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in order to achieve a goal.

 * Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset o all the instructions.

 * Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task programmatically.

 * To approach writing a script, break down your goal into  a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
