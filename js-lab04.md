# Chapter 3: Functions, Methods & Objects

## What is function?
### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
## Terminology of function:
  - Calling function: When you ask the function to perform its task its known as calling function.
  - Parameters: The pieces of information pass to the function known as parameters.
  - Return value: When you write a function and you expect it to provide you with an answer, the response is known as a return value.

## To create a function, you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.

## Calling a function 
### Having declared the function, you can then execute all the statements between its curly braces with just one line of code.This is known as **calling the function**.

## Declaring functions that need information

### sometimes a function needs specific information to perform its task.In such cases, when you declare the function you give it **parameters**.Inside the function, the parameters act like variables.

## Calling functions that need information
### When you call function that has parameters, you specify the values it should use in the parentheses that follow its name. The values are called **arguments**, and they can be provided as values or variables.

## Getting a single value out of a function

### Some function return information to the code that called them. For example, when they perform a calculation , they return the result.

## Getting multiple values out of a function
### Functions can return more than one value using an array.For example, this function calculate the area volume of a box.
